### CPSC 120

Lab 7
Lab 7 part 2 is one of my favorites because this is the first little game that I wrote, and that really made me into computer science. After I write the code, I know how the Black Jack works and how it calculates all the cards and how it shows all the output after your choice.

Lab 4
Lab 4 part 2 is one of my favorites because this is the first time we use code to solve a real life question, and we really create the equation to change feet to inches, that let me know coding is not only creating websites and games and apps, coding also can make real life questions easier.

Lab 10
Lab 12 part 1 is one of my favorites because this is the first time we create an animation image, in Lab 10 we create a simple colorful image but just an image, but in lab 12 we really create a moving image, that makes me know how to make the image moving and makes me imagine what I can do with coding in the future.
